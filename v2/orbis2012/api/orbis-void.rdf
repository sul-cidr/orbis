         <dcterms:title>ORBIS: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World</dcterms:title>
         <dcterms:description>ORBIS seeks to better understand the shape of the ancient world as it 
           was influenced by location, time of year, priority, and mode of travel. 
           It presents this information using traditional cartographic methods and 
           data visualization. This is made possible through the use of a network 
           transportation model based on historical maritime and terrestrial 
           routes, as well as cost in time and money based on historical sources 
           and simulations.</dcterms:description>
