<h2>Using ORBIS</h2>
<p>ORBIS is not just a website, it is a Digital Scholarly Work created around a transportation model of the Roman world. As such, there are several different ways to access the information stored in this work:</p>

<h4>As a Paper</h4>

<p>Most of the textual content of ORBIS is available verbatim as <a href="ORBIS_v1paper_20120501.pdf" target="_blank">a traditional paper</a>, including the "Introducing," "Understanding," and "Building" sections as well as "Examples" from the "Using" section. Dynamic and interactive elements are replaced by static images.</p>

<h4>Finding Routes</h4>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KwoshD3esdc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The interactive route map is the principal interface for our transportation model. To establish a historical route from one of the sites in our model to another, you simply select the start and destination sites from the two drop-down lists. Sites are named in accordance with <span class="italic">The Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World</span> Routes differ depending on whether you are looking for the fastest, cheapest or shortest connection, on the modes and means (here called options) of transport, and on the month of the year.</p>

<div class="inlinepic_plain"><img src="images/using_01.png"/></div>

<p>Click "calculate route" to obtain cost information and a path for the route you have selected. Fastest routes are displayed in purple, cheapest routes in green, and shortest routes in yellow.</p>

<p>"Fastest" calculates the route that takes the least amount of time. Its path is highly dependent on the type of transportation you select. For example, faster land speeds may obviate the need for usually fast but often indirect sea travel.</p>

<p>"Cheapest" gives you the route with the lowest total cost priced in <span class="italic">denarii</span> (<span class="italic">communes</span>), a late Roman currency denomination used in the records from which we derive our price simulations. Price costs based on the modes and means of transport you choose. Transport of goods (exemplified by grain) and passenger travel incur different costs, and the price of grain transport on land varies depending on whether it is carried out by pack animals or wagons. As a result, there could be three different cheapest routes between two points.</p>

<p>"Shortest" only takes account of total distance, via the transportation network, from one point to another. The shortest route will often not be the fastest or cheapest one.</p>

<div class="inlinepic_plain"><img src="images/using_02.png"/></div>
<p>When you first access the map, all principal network modes are enabled by default. Disable individual modes as desired. Open sea and coastal sea routes operate 24 hours a day. Both of these modes must be enabled to access the complete maritime route network. Coastal sea routes and coastal sea (daytime) routes cannot be enabled at the same time. For travel on rivers, choose between a faster military boat and a slower civilian boat. A faster and a slower sailing option are available for sea travel. The interface offers a variety of road options: each of the speed options corresponds to a specific daily travel speed. Speed options are only available for queries for fastest and shortest connections. Each of the price options corresponds to a specific expense for a cargo unit or passenger. Price options are only available for queries for cheapest connections.</p>

<p>If you want to find out how your route changes if you avoid travel by land, river, open sea or coastal sea lanes, deselect particular modes from this menu. For instance, if you only want to use coastal sea routes, simply uncheck the "Open sea" box. Note that unchecking boxes renders sites inaccessible if they can only be reached by the deselected modes of travel.</p>

<div class="inlinepic_plain"><img src="images/route_response2.png"/></div>

<p>Cost results appear in the "Calculated route" box in the lower left-hand corner of the map. All results include the required days of travel (rounded to one decimal point) and the distance covered (in kilometers). Queries for routes that do not involve road travel generate prices based on sea and/or (civilian) river transport. Queries for routes that involve road travel generate prices that take account of all types of road travel for which specific historical price information is available, regardless of whether these are actually employed in the calculated route. This function is explained in detail in "<a href="#" onclick="goSubtab('using_tabs',1)">Examples</a>."</p>

<div class="inlinepic_plain"><img src="images/timeline.png"/></div>
<p>As you query routes, they appear both on the map and in a simple timeline that shows each stop below the map. The timeline displays the name of each site when you move your mouse over it. The distance between each site corresponds to the length of each segment of the trip, measured from left to right (the sites are displaced up and down to keep labels from overlapping).</p>

<div class="inlinepic_plain"><img src="images/route_grid.png"/></div>
<p>You may also view your results in a grid by clicking on "results grid". This function even allows you to download your routes as KML to view them in Google Earth.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>
The "<a href="#" onclick="goSubtab('using_tabs',1)">Examples section</a>" illustrates and explains the outcomes of specific route simulations by walking you through several cases.
</p>
<h4>Distance Cartograms</h4>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbN8e6xC1M0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<div class="inlinepic_plain"><a href="#" onclick="picWin('using_fig07_1000w.png', 'Interactive distance cartogram')"><img src="figures/using_fig07_550w.png"/></a></div><!--<a href="#" onclick="goTab(1)">Introducing ORBIS</a>-->
<p>Located within the "<a href="#" onclick="goRemoteTab(5,'mapping_tabs',1)">Mapping ORBIS</a>" section, the dynamic distance cartogram allows you to view the entire network from the perspective of one of four cities: Roma, Constantinopolis (Istanbul), Londinium (London), and Antiochia (Antakya). By clicking on the city and the travel type (either fastest or cheapest) you can see how the empire was shaped by the cost (in time or money) of traveling or shipping goods to that city from all the other sites in our network. When you click on the city name, the network will be distorted so that the city selected is at the center, with the distance (in terms of cost) from the city displayed in concentric rings. Color likewise indicates distance, and if you select "No Distortion" the sites will be arranged geographically so that you can see cost distances on a traditional map. Labels can be turned on and off by clicking individual sites, but this feature is still problematic and all labels can be turned off by selecting "Clear Labels".</p>
<h4>Network Visualization</h4>
<div class="inlinepic_plain"><a href="#" onclick="picWin('using_fig08_1000w.png', 'Network visualization')"><img src="figures/using_fig08_550w.png"/></a></div>
<p>The "<a href="#" onclick="goRemoteTab(2,'understanding_tabs',0)">Understanding ORBIS</a>" section also includes a representation of the network structure upon which the pathfinding occurs. At its core, ORBIS is a set of geographic networks. This visualization displays it as such, showing you the routes (known as "edges" in network parlance) that connect particular sites (referred to as "nodes" in network analysis). A few traditional network analysis measurements are also included, as well as a cost in <span class="italic">denarii</span> to ship grain from Rome to the selected site.</p>
<p>To use the network visualization, click on any city and its attributes will be displayed on the left, including the cities it is connected to. You can also zoom in and out of the network as well as use the magnifying glass to look over the network with a center-focused view.</p>
<h4>API Access</h4>
<p>We plan to provide access to the routing interface via API, as well as the paths and motion events that make up the model, in the near future.</p>
